## Installing

Run `npm i`

âš  Note: to launch Storybook you need to install
the [UI Kit](https://dev.azure.com/projetsrtm/EXO%20UI%20Kit/_git/ngx-chrono-ui-kit) before. In order to make it work,
you have to install your folders inside the same folder:

`parent-folder` containing:

- ngx-chrono-ui-kit
- storybook-chrono-saeiv

## Local development

<br />To get more familiar with the UI Kit, you can check
its [dedicated](https://dev.azure.com/projetsrtm/EXO%20UI%20Kit/_git/ngx-chrono-ui-kit?path=/projects/core)
documentation.

Run `npm run local` to start the local server. The default port is [6006](http://localhost:6006), the app will launch
the webpage automatically and reload if you change any source files.

## Production development
